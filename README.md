## [0. Introduction](#introduction)
Python is a programming language that is easy to learn and has a large community of users. It is used in many fields of science and engineering. Python is a good choice for hydrologists because it is free, open source, and has a large number of libraries for scientific computing. 

In this tutorial, we will be using Jupyter Notebooks that allow interactive coding. Jupyter Notebooks are a great way to learn Python because you can run code in small chunks and see the results immediately.

## [1. Download of Tutorial files](#download-of-tutorial)
The tutorial files are available on hydrosolutions public GitHub repository [python_tutorial_for_CA_hydrologists](https://github.com/hydrosolutions/python_tutorial_for_CA_hydrologists/). You can download them as a zip file by clicking on the green button "Code" and then "Download ZIP". Unzip the file and save it in a location of your choice.

## [2. Installation of Python](#installation)
There are many ways to install Python. The easiest way is to install the Anaconda distribution. Anaconda is a free and open source distribution of Python and R programming languages for scientific computing. It is used for large-scale data processing, predictive analytics, and scientific computing. Anaconda comes with more than 1,000 open source packages.

The [Anaconda website](https://docs.anaconda.com/free/anaconda/install/index.html) has instructions for installing Anaconda on Windows, macOS, and Linux. Please follow the instructions for your operating system. When the installation is complete, open the Anaconda Navigator.

### 3.0. Basic concepts
Many tutorials are available on the web to introduce basic concepts of Python. Here are a few examples:
- [Videos & exercises from University of Waterloo](https://open.cs.uwaterloo.ca/python-from-scratch/). This tutorial offers an in-depth introduction to Python. It is a good choice if you have no prior experience with Python, you want to commit to gaining a solid base, and you prefer learning through videos.  
- [Interactive online course for Python](https://cscircles.cemc.uwaterloo.ca/). This tutorial offers an in-depth introduction to Python. It is a good choice if you have no prior experience with Python, you want to commit to gaining a solid base, and you prefer learning through text.  
- [Python for Hydrology](https://github.com/DOI-USGS/python-for-hydrology/). This tutorial is tailored to hydrologists. The tutorial is suitable for beginners and intermediate users. It consists of many Jupyter Notebooks that you can download and run on your computer. It is best suited for hydrologists but requires some prior experience with Jupyter Notebooks.  
- [Introduction to Jupyter Notebooks and Jupyter Lab A](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjjE-MJD5TI&t=1267s). This video (starting from minute 21:07) is a good introduction to Jupyter Notebooks in Jupyter Lab. It is suitable for beginners and intermediate users. If you don't like the style of the video linked above I recommend [this one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wfPqAyYADY) (just launch Jupyter Lab from Anaconda insterad of using notebook.ai as suggested in the video).  

### 3.1. Open Jupyter Lab
In your Anaconda Navigator, check if Jupyter Lab is installed. If not, install it. Then launch Jupyter Lab. This will open a brower window with Jupyter Lab. In the left sidebar, navigate to the folder where you saved the tutorial files. Open the file "00_plotting_a_hydrograph.ipynb". This will open a new tab in your browser. You are now ready to start coding!
